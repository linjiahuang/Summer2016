There are a total of 27 folders, each corresponding to a different set of simulation parameters. 
The simulation parameters used are:

n = [10, 100, 500]
maf = [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
K = [3, 10, 100]

The folders are named according to the simulation parameter. For example, if a folder is named file_n=10-maf=5=K=3, then n=10, maf=0.05 and K=3.

Each folder contains 1500 txt files: 500 are simulations, 500 are permutations and 500 are parameter specifications. The txt files are also
named according to the simulation parameters.
